You are acting as a senior full-stack software engineer, AI systems engineer, and technical architect.

Your task is to BUILD (not just design) a complete MVP system called **EdoSecure AI** — an AI-powered security intelligence and surveillance coordination platform intended for a government security demo and pilot deployment.

This is a HANDS-ON IMPLEMENTATION request.

========================
PROJECT GOAL
========================
Develop a fully functional MVP that demonstrates:
- Centralized security command dashboard
- AI-powered video analytics
- Real-time incident detection and alerts
- Map-based incident visualization
- Scalable backend architecture
- Clean, professional UI suitable for government presentation

The system must be practical, demo-ready, and structured in a way that allows easy modification and extension by a human developer (me).

========================
BUILD APPROACH
========================
You must:
1. Build the system STEP BY STEP
2. Start from FRONTEND → BACKEND → AI MODULES → INTEGRATIONS
3. Generate ACTUAL CODE for EVERY FILE involved
4. Clearly explain:
   - What each file does
   - How files connect together
5. Pause after each major phase so I can review and request changes
6. Use clean, readable, well-structured code (production-minded, not hacky)

Do NOT skip steps.
Do NOT give pseudo-code unless explicitly requested.
Do NOT bundle everything in one message — work incrementally.

========================
TECH STACK (MVP STANDARD)
========================

FRONTEND:
- Next.js (React)
- Tailwind CSS
- Map library (Leaflet or Google Maps)
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

BACKEND:
- Python
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- WebSockets
- REST APIs

AI / VIDEO ANALYTICS:
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (person, crowd, motion detection)
- Rule-based alert logic
- Support for recorded video (for demo) and live streams (future)

OTHER:
- Docker-ready structure (optional but preferred)
- Clear folder structure
- Environment variables for secrets
- Mock or simulated drone & CCTV feeds for MVP

========================
CORE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
========================

1. FRONTEND DASHBOARD
- Secure login (basic MVP auth)
- Live video feed panels (simulated streams allowed)
- Incident alert panel (real-time)
- Edo State map view with incident pins
- Heat map view (historical incidents)
- Clean, calm, government-friendly UI

2. BACKEND SERVICES
- Authentication service
- Incident management service
- Video stream ingestion endpoints
- AI inference trigger endpoints
- Alert broadcasting (WebSockets)
- Incident storage (PostgreSQL)

3. AI SMART CAPABILITIES
- Person detection from video
- Crowd detection (basic threshold-based)
- Motion anomaly detection
- Night activity detection (simple rule-based)
- Short video clip capture on incident
- Confidence score per alert

4. ALERT SYSTEM
- Real-time dashboard alerts
- API-based alert publishing
- Simulated SMS/email/WhatsApp hooks (MVP-level)

5. MAP & ANALYTICS
- Incident geolocation storage
- Live incident markers
- Historical heat map generation
- Time-based filtering

========================
PROJECT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
========================

You must define and generate code for:
- Full frontend folder structure
- Full backend folder structure
- AI service modules
- Configuration files
- Environment variable examples
- README instructions (run locally)

Each file must be provided with:
- Filename
- Purpose explanation
- Full code content

========================
WORKFLOW YOU MUST FOLLOW
========================

PHASE 1 – FRONTEND
- Project setup
- Folder structure
- UI layout
- Dashboard pages
- Map integration
- WebSocket integration

PHASE 2 – BACKEND
- FastAPI setup
- Database models
- API routes
- WebSocket server
- Incident handling logic

PHASE 3 – AI MODULES
- Video ingestion
- AI inference pipeline
- Rule engine
- Alert generation

PHASE 4 – INTEGRATION
- Frontend ↔ Backend
- Backend ↔ AI service
- Real-time alert flow

PHASE 5 – MVP POLISH
- Demo data
- Simulated incidents
- Performance sanity checks
- Deployment readiness notes

========================
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
========================

- This is NOT a tutorial.
- This is NOT theoretical.
- This is NOT a student exercise.

This is a GOVERNMENT-FACING MVP.

Code must be:
- Understandable
- Modular
- Editable by me
- Demo-stable

========================
COMMUNICATION RULES
========================

- Speak like a senior engineer
- Be direct and structured
- Ask clarification ONLY when necessary
- After each phase, stop and wait for approval before continuing

========================
STARTING INSTRUCTION
========================

Begin with:
PHASE 1 – FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE & SETUP

Explain the frontend folder structure first, then generate the code file by file.
